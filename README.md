# Catarse QR Code Generator

This project is a simple web-based QR Code generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is tailored for the Catarse platform.

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Input any valid URL and generate a corresponding QR code.
- **Auto-Download**: The generated QR code is automatically downloaded as a PNG file with a filename that includes the URL.
